# CS 5820 Group Project
 Exercises 2.8 â€“ 2.13 [1]
## What is this?
This project is designed to answer a few questions from our class textbook in regards to a "vacuum cleaner world".
In this world, we have a number of tiles.  Some are dirty and some are clean.  We implement an agent, in this case a 'vacuum cleaner', to 
go tile by tile and 'clean' all of the dirty tiles.  We try to do this in the least amount of steps possible.
